Vanguard Project

In this project I have carried out an A/B data analysis between the current website of a company and its new version to see if the new version increases the number of income of the company

I have used 3 tables of information: One of general data of the clients, the second tells us which clients have used the old website and who have used the new one and finally the last table contains information about the interactions of the clients with the website

To perform the data analysis I used Jupyter Notebook, SQL and Tableau

CONCLUSIONS
The new website has demonstrated greater performance when it comes to attracting new customers and therefore recommends the company update its website.
